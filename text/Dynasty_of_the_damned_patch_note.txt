Now Jiangshi faction uses new subtypes instead of vanilla one for following agent_subtypes
-- wh_main_vmp_master_necromancer, wh_main_vmp_necromancer, and wh_main_vmp_wight_king
Replaced armoury, necromancer, and ossuary building to custom one to allow recruitment of new agent_subtypes without making building browser UI too messy
- cleaned up raise dead script a little bit

--All is Dust & Moloch 
- Made Chinese type cart and applied to units and the necromancer lord & hero
